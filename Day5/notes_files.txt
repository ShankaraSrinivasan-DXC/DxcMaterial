Files : 

A file is a collection of data, that which allows you to store the output permanently.

To deal with files, we need java.io package. 

File class : This class allows you to deal with files.

File f1 = new File(filename);

methods : 
__________

getName()
getParent()
getPath()

FileWriter : This class allows you to write the contents into the file w.r.t. Unicode format. 

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filename);

write() : used to write data. 

FileReader : Used to read data char/char and returns the ascii value. (We have to typecast and print) 

read() : Used to read data char/char and returns ascii value, it returns -1 once it reaches the 
end of file. 

FileInputStream  : Used to read data w.r.t. Stream of Bytes. 

read() : Used to read data char/char and returns ascii value, it returns -1 once it reaches the end of file. 


FileOutputStream : Used to write data w.r.t. Stream of bytes. 

write() : Used to write data char/char into the file. 


DataOutputStream : Used to write primitive data into the file. 

DataOutputStream dout = new DataOutputStream(filename);

writeInt()
writeDouble()
writeUTF() 
writeBoolean() 

DataInputStream : Used to read primitives from the file. 

readInt()
readDouble()
readUTF()
readBoolean()

BufferedReader : Allows you to read data from the keyboard. 

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

readLine() : used to read one line of input. 

ObjectOutputStream : Used to write objects into the file. 

ObjectOutputStream objout=new ObjectOutputStream(filename);

writeObject() -> Used to write object into the file. 

ObjectInputStream : Used to read objects from the file. 

readObject() : Used to read object from the file. 

Serilization : Used to write Custom Objects into the file. 

Application Architecture : 
__________________________

There are 3 types of application architectures as 

	1) Single Tier

	2) Two Tier

	3) Three Tier 

Each Application architecture contains 3 layers as 

	1) User Services : Presentation Layer

	2) Business Services : Performs all business operations and validations

	3) Data Services : Used to store data. 

StudentDAL class (its data layer class), in that we have to perform the following operations as

	1) Add Student

	2) Show Student

	3) Search Student

	4) Update Student

	5) Delete Student 


Here, we need a list of students, where all objects needs to be accessed. 

Validations : 
______________


	1) Sno not negative

	2) name min 3 chars

	3) city min 3 chars

	4) cgp not negative
